SNHU CS 360 Project Three

Matthew Cochrane

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements of this project were to create event tracking app that can create, read, update and delete events in an SQLite database. In addition to this, users are required to log in before using their app, and each user has a database that is saved for future use.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were you designs successful?
There are three main screens that are implemented: login screen, database screen, and the add event screen. The overall theme of the app is earth tones (brown, light green, light tan) and this means a UI that is easy to look at for extended periods.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The method I used was to implement the least methods per class, and if a particular class started looking too clunky, it most likely meant that class could be broken down and refactored into multiple classes. This aided greatly in organization.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
After each small adjustment to the application code, I ran the app in the Android Emulator. This testing method is known as white box testing since I, the developer, have access to the entire development pipeline including what the user sees.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The main challenge I found was sharing data between all the different activities, and it took quite a bit of trial and error to get the functionality right.

In what specific component from you mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I did the best job in deciding how to present information to the user, as in "Does this need a new activity, or can it be a dialog box? A toast?" The app feels balanced between these display components in my opinion.
